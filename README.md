# Triangle-Simulator

## Getting Started

0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Create a virtual environment.

```
conda create -n tri_env python=3.9.19
conda activate tri_env
```
2) Install the required packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that Triangle itself does not depend on PyCBC, and we only use it for demonstration.
